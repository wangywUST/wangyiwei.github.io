<img src='lab_logo.png' width = "500"><br/>

## Research Aim

At the UC Merced NLP Lab, we envision a future where language model based AI systems converge to create trustworthy intelligent assistants to serve humans in most scenarios, e.g., education, healthcare, information search. Our mission is to pioneer transformative technologies at this intersection, developing next-generation systems that are both technologically advanced and human-centric, ultimately building the foundation for a fully connected, intelligent world.

## Team Members


## My Support and Expectations

Our research is highly interdisciplinary, involving collaboration with experts from AI, networking systems, human–computer interaction, psychology, and electrical engineering. Our focus is primarily on publishing in top-tier AI conferences and IEEE journals, complemented by practical implementations. Our primary goal is to prepare our students for future academic positions as well as high-impact positions in industry. Here's what we're looking for and what you can expect from this journey:

### 1. What I Offer:
- Resources: Full scholarships covering study and living in Hong Kong, plus access to advanced research facilities.
- Guidance: **Hands-on mentorship with clear direction.** For outstanding students, I also offer adequate freedom and opportunities for growth.
- International Connections: Strong ties with leading researchers and institutions worldwide. I will help you build international academic connections.
- Friendly Environment and Work-Life Balance: Collaborative and supportive lab culture where teamwork and mutual respect are valued. **Say no to 996; embrace sustainable productivity.**

### 2. What I Expect from You:
- Passion for Learning: **Strong self-motivation and ability to quickly learn from new fields.**
- Academic Foundation: Academic background in computer science, AI, electrical engineering, electronic information/communication engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Candidates with bachelor's degrees from <i>985 / QS Top 50 universities</i> or <i>211 / QS Top 80 universities + strong publication records</i> are encouraged due to HKU committee considerations.
- Experience: Relevant research experience and coding ability demonstrated through papers, projects, or competitions.
- Personal Qualities: Responsibility, reliability, and good communication skills.
- Graduation Requirements: A PhD degree is just a ticket for your future career, so there is NO requirement for the NUMBER of papers. **Instead, the graduation requirement is for us to work together to help you find a satisfactory job, which marks the success of our collaborative journey.**
