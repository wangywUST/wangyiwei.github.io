# About Me

**I will join the Department of Computer Science at [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in the Spring of 2025.**<br>

**Recruiting Ph.D. students and (remote) research interns.** Iâ€™m actively looking for students at all levels interested in large language models' research. If you are interested, please feel free to email me.<br>

I am currently a Postdoc at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) advised by [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/members/) and [Prof. Nanyun Peng](https://vnpeng.net/group/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io/) and collaborate with [Prof. Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/). My recent research is focused on **trustworthy large language models**.
